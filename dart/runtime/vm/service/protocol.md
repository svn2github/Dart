## Types

Every response returned by the VM Service has the <code>type</code> property.  This allows the client distinguish between different kinds of responses.  For example, global information about the VM is encoded in an response of type [VM](#VM) and information about an isolate is encoded in an response of type [Isolate](#Isolate).

If the type name of a response begins with an <code>@</code> character then that response is a _reference_.  If the type name of a response does not begin with an <code>@</code> character then that response is an _object_ (or sometimes _full object_).  A reference is meant to be a subset of a full object with just enough information for the client to generate a reasonable-looking link.

For example, an isolate reference may look like this...

    {
      type: "@Isolate",
      id: "isolates/123",
      name: "worker"
    }

... and a full isolate object would have additional properties:

    {
      type: "@Isolate",
      id: "isolates/123",
      name: "worker"
      entry: ...
      heaps: ...
      topFrame: ...
      ...
    }
 
## IDs

Most responses returned by the VM Service have an <code>id</code> property.  An id is used to request an object from the VM.

An id is either _global_ or _relative_.  Global ids can be requested from the VM directly by requesting the uri <code>/{global id}</code>.

The following is a list of known,  fixed global ids:

| id | uri | type
| --- | --- | ---
| vm | /vm | [VM](#VM)
| flags | /flags | [FlagList](#FlagList)

In addition, all isolates have global ids, but these ids are dynamically generated.  An isolate with an id like <code>isolates/123</code> would be available at the uri <code>/isolates/123</code>.

Relative ids are used to refer to objects that are owned by an isolate.  Relative ids can be requested from the VM directly by requesting the uri <code>/{isolate&nbsp;id}/{relative&nbsp;id}</code>.

For example, we can get information about a class with id <code>classes/Foo</code> from isolate <code>isolates/123</code> by requesting the uri <code>/isolates/123/classes/Foo</code> from the VM.

The client must not parse ids -- they must be treated as opaque strings.  We reserve the right to change the ids of objects.

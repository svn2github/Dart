[ $runtime == vm && $system == macos ]
# This test fails with "Too many open files" on the Mac OS buildbot.
# This is expected as MacOS by default runs with a very low number
# of allowed open files ('ulimit -n' says something like 256).
io/socket_many_connections_test: Skip

# These tests pass on MacOS 10.8.2 but fails on the buildbot machines
# that are running an earlier version of MacOS. The issue is that the
# old version of MacOS does not expand the precomposed utf-8 it gets
# from the VM before comparing it to the decomposed utf-8 used for the
# file system.

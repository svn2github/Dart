# In order to maintain maximum test coverage for all builds,
# please use the following procedure to mark a test
# failed on architectures other than the one you are working on.
#
# 1) Copy the old version of the test to
#    tests/language/src/test_name_[dartc|vm]_test.dart.
#    to maintain coverage.
# 2) File a bug on each architecture for the failure due to the language change.
# 3) Update the language/src directory with the updated test.

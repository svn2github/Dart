   * Get the changes required to perform a refactoring.
   *
   * Parameters
   *
   * kindId ( RefactoringKind )
   *
   *   The identifier of the kind of refactoring to be performed.
   *
   * file ( FilePath )
   *
   *   The file containing the code involved in the refactoring.
   *
   * offset ( int )
   *
   *   The offset of the region involved in the refactoring.
   *
   * length ( int )
   *
   *   The length of the region involved in the refactoring.
   *
   * validateOnly ( bool )
   *
   *   True if the client is only requesting that the values of the options be
   *   validated and no change be generated.
   *
   * options ( optional object )
   *
   *   Data used to provide values provided by the user. The structure of the
   *   data is dependent on the kind of refactoring being performed. The data
   *   that is expected is documented in the section titled Refactorings,
   *   labeled as “Options”. This field can be omitted if the refactoring does
   *   not require any options or if the values of those options are not known.
   *
   * Returns
   *
   * status ( List<RefactoringProblem> )
   *
   *   The status of the refactoring. The array will be empty if there are no
   *   known problems.
   *
   * feedback ( optional object )
   *
   *   Data used to provide feedback to the user. The structure of the data is
   *   dependent on the kind of refactoring being created. The data that is
   *   returned is documented in the section titled Refactorings, labeled as
   *   “Feedback”.
   *
   * change ( optional SourceChange )
   *
   *   The changes that are to be applied to affect the refactoring. This field
   *   will be omitted if there are problems that prevent a set of changed from
   *   being computed, such as having no options specified for a refactoring
   *   that requires them, or if only validation was requested.

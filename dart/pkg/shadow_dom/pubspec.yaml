description: >
  Shadow DOM is designed to provide encapsulation by hiding DOM subtrees under
  shadow roots. It provides a method of establishing and maintaining functional
  boundaries between DOM trees and how these trees interact with each other
  within a document, thus enabling better functional encapsulation within the
  DOM.

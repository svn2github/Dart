Welcome to the Dart API reference documentation,
covering the official Dart APIs (dart:*)
as well as other packages that live in the Dart project.
For help using the Dart APIs, also see
[www.dartlang.org](https://www.dartlang.org)
pages such as the following:

  * [Programmer's Guide](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/)
  * [A Tour of the Dart Libraries](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch03.html)
  * [Dart Cookbook](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/cookbook/)
  * [Articles](https://www.dartlang.org/articles/)
  
The API reference is automatically generated from the source code in the
[Dart project](https://code.google.com/p/dart/).

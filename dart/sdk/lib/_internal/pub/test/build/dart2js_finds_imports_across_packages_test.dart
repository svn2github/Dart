  // This is a regression test for https://dartbug.com/15183. The code that
  // stripped .dart files from release builds was in the forwarding transformer,
  // and that transformer was applied to all loaded packages. That meant that
  // if the root package imported a .dart file from another package, the
  // forwarding transformer in that package would remove the file before
  // dart2js could find it when compiling the entrypoint in the root package.

/// The currently supported versions of the Barback package that this version of
/// pub works with.
///
/// Pub implicitly constrains barback to these versions.
///
/// Barback is in a unique position. Pub imports it, so a copy of Barback is
/// physically included in the SDK. Packages also depend on Barback (from
/// pub.dartlang.org) when they implement their own transformers. Pub's plug-in
/// API dynamically loads transformers into their own isolate.
///
/// This includes a Dart file (`asset/dart/transformer_isolate.dart`) which
/// imports "package:barback/barback.dart". This file is included in the SDK,
/// but that import is resolved using the applicationâ€™s version of Barback. That
/// means pub must tightly control which version of Barback the application is
/// using so that it's one that pub supports.
///
/// Whenever a new minor or patch version of barback is published, this *must*
/// be incremented to synchronize with that. See the barback [compatibility
/// documentation][compat] for details on the relationship between this
/// constraint and barback's version.

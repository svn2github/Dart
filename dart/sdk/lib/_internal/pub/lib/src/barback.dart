/// physically included in the SDK. Packages also depend on Barback (from
/// pub.dartlang.org) when they implement their own transformers. Pub's plug-in
/// API dynamically loads transformers into their own isolate.
///
/// This includes a string literal of Dart code ([_TRANSFORMER_ISOLATE] in
/// load_transformers.dart). That code imports "package:barback/barback.dart".
/// This string is included in the SDK, but that import is resolved using the
/// applicationâ€™s version of Barback. That means it must tightly control which
/// version of Barback the application is using so that it's one that pub
/// supports.
///
/// Whenever a new non-patch version of barback is published, this *must* be
/// incremented to synchronize with that.
